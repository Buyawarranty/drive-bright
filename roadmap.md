# Roadmap

## Dial 9 call timing and Adam's totals
- [ ] Measure scheduled import timing and actual arrival delay for Adam's calls.
- [ ] Correct any confirmed stale totals or missing-call behaviour without changing call credit.
- [ ] Run focused checks and report measured timing and limitations.

## Single pricing-plan editor
- [x] Add Edit and section shortcuts opening one named pop-up with grid, vehicle variables and website difference.
- [x] Keep edits and whole-plan saves isolated to the selected plan; offer a named new-plan save.
- [x] 49 pricing tests passed; public access redirects to sign-in without runtime errors; live prices unchanged.
- [ ] Authenticated save/read-back and pop-up visual checks: unavailable with external unmanaged Supabase session.

## Expired warranties — done 23 Oct 2026
- [x] DB: `expire_overdue_policies()` + nightly cron + backfill (28 policies, 9 customers)
- [x] Customer Management: "Expired" status filter; hidden from default view; grey badge
- [x] Renewals queue includes expired policies in recently_expired / all_renewals segments
- [x] Build OK; memory saved
